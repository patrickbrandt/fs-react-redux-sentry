# Understanding React + Redux errors with Sentry and FullStory
[Sentry](https://sentry.io) is an error monitoring platform used by development teams around the world to identify when issues crop up in their applications. [FullStory](https://www.fullstory.com) lets development teams view user experience friction through the eyes of their users.

Sentry + FullStory arms development teams with an unprecedented ability to understand the details around the issues impacting their users.

## Searching Hacker News
The Search Hacker News React/Redux app example in this repo is based on [Robin Weiruch’s fantastic tutorial](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-redux-tutorial/). There are a few differences from Robin’s original example:

1. [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) are used instead of class components and lifecycle events.
2. [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) is used for fetching stories from Hacker News rather than redux-saga.
3. This app is (deliberately) riddled with bugs :)

You can try out the Search Hacker News app [here](http://fs-redux-sentry.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/) or you can clone this repo and `npm install` then `npm run start`. The code is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Setting up FullStory
You’ll need a FullStory [Professional](https://www.fullstory.com/pricing/) account, though you can get a two-week free trial if you want to try out Sentry + FullStory cost-free. Once you’ve setup an account, update the `_fs_org` value in the [FullStory snippet](https://help.fullstory.com/using/recording-snippet) in [public/index.html](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/public/index.html):

```JavaScript
window['_fs_org'] = 'your org id here';
```

### Setting up Sentry
Sentry should be initialized as soon as possible during your application load up. In Search Hacker News, `Sentry.init` is called before the `App` component is loaded in [src/index.js](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/index.js).

```JSX
...
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';

Sentry.init({ dsn: 'https://<your key>@sentry.io/<your project>' });

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);

```
Once you are logged into Sentry, go [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/react/) to find your `Sentry.init` statement (prefilled with your key and project values).

## How FullStory links with Sentry
FullStory’s [`FS.getCurrentSessionURL`](https://help.fullstory.com/develop-js/getcurrentsessionurl) API function retrieves a session replay URL for a particular moment in time. These URLs are deep links that can be shared with other tools and services. Session URLs are embedded into Sentry events using [Sentry scopes](https://docs.sentry.io/enriching-error-data/scopes/). The [`recordError`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/api/error.js) function puts it all together.

```JavaScript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/browser';
import * as FullStory from './fullstory';

const recordError = (error, extraInfo = null) => {
  Sentry.withScope(scope => {
    if (extraInfo) {
      scope.setExtras(extraInfo);
    }

    // send a deep link to a FullStory session at the moment the error was recorded
    scope.setExtra('fullstory', FullStory.getCurrentSessionURL(true));
    error.sentryEventId = Sentry.captureException(error);
  });

  // send error data into FullStory to find users who experienced errors
  FullStory.event('Application error', {
    name: error.name,
    message: error.message,
    fileName: error.fileName,
    lineNumber: error.lineNumber,
    stack: error.stack,
    sentryEventId: error.sentryEventId,
  });
}

export default recordError;
```

We’re also using the FullStory [custom events API](https://help.fullstory.com/develop-js/363565-fs-event-api-sending-custom-event-data-into-fullstory) to send error data into FullStory. This lets us search for all users that experienced errors on the Search Hacker News app.

## All the things that can go wrong...

### Handling and reviewing errors in React components
React 16 introduced [Error Boundaries](https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html) to handle exceptions thrown while rendering components.

There's a single error boundary in Search Hacker News surrounding the [`App`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/components/App.js) component declaration:

```JSX
import React from 'react';
import './App.css';
import SearchStories from './SearchStories';
import Stories from './Stories';
import ErrorToast from './ErrorToast';
import ErrorBoundary from './ErrorBoundry';

const App = () => (
  <div className="app">
    <ErrorBoundary>
      <ErrorToast></ErrorToast>
      <div className="interactions">
        <SearchStories />
      </div>
      <Stories />
    </ErrorBoundary>
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

This is the [ErrorBoundry component](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/components/ErrorBoundry.js) definition:

```JSX
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import recordError from '../api/error';

class ErrorBoundary extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { error: null, eventId: null };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    this.setState({ error });
    recordError(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      //render fallback UI
      return (
        <div className="error">
          <h1>Something bad happened and we've been notified</h1>
          <p>In the mean time, search for <a href="/?query=happiness">happiness</a></p>
        </div>
      );
    } else {
      //when there's not an error, render children untouched
      return this.props.children;
    }
  }
}

export default ErrorBoundary;
```
This ErrorBoundry component invokes [`recordError`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/api/error.js) in `componentDidCatch`, which sends the error data to Sentry with a session reply URL.

#### No offense fellow Floridians
If you search for “Florida” an error is thrown from the [SearchStories](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/components/SearchStories.js) component (a poke at my home state). This is what the error looks like in Sentry:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45576380/59303785-f06ffc80-8c64-11e9-9927-49b90f9b7381.png)

A FullStory session replay URL is included in the Sentry issue that deep links to the moment the issue was created.

Clicking on this link allows you to see the user’s actions leading up to and following the error in a FullStory session replay.

### Handling errors in Redux action creators
Action creator functions are another likely source of errors, especially if you're performing side-effects and dispatching other actions. The integration with the Hacker News API occurs in the [story action creator](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/actions/story.js)

```JavaScript
import { STORIES_ADD } from '../constants/actionTypes';
import { doBeginLoad, doEndLoad } from './loader';
import { doError } from './error';
import fetchStories from '../api/storys';

const doAddStories = stories => ({
  type: STORIES_ADD,
  stories,
});

const doFetchStoriesAsync = query => async dispatch => {
  dispatch(doBeginLoad());
  try {
    if (query === 'break it') throw new Error('Broken on demand!');
    const response = await fetchStories(query);
    dispatch(doAddStories(response.hits));
    dispatch(doEndLoad());
  } catch (err) {
    dispatch(doEndLoad());
    dispatch(doError(err));
  }
  
};

export {
  doAddStories,
  doFetchStoriesAsync,
};
```
Type "break it" into the search field to trigger yet another contrived error :)

### Catching unhandled errors in action creators and reducers
What if an action creator or reducer _forgets_ to handle errors appropriately? [Redux Middleware](https://redux.js.org/advanced/middleware) can help. The Search Headline News app includes a [`crashReporter`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/store/crashReporter.js) middleware that will catch unhandled exceptions thrown from thunk action creators (action creators that return a function like [`src/actions/story.js`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/actions/story.js)) and any reducer.

```JavaScript
import { doError } from '../actions/error';

const crashReporter = store => next => action => {
  // we got a thunk
  if (typeof action === 'function') {
    // wrap it in a function to try/catch the downstream invocation
    const wrapAction = fn => async (dispatch, getState, extraArgument) => {
      try {
        await fn(dispatch, getState, extraArgument);
      } catch (e) {
        dispatch(doError(e));
      }
    }
    // send wrapped function to the next middleware
    // this should be upstream from redux-thunk middleware
    return next(wrapAction(action));
  }
  
  try {
    return next(action);
  } catch (e) {
      store.dispatch(doError(e));
  }
};

export default crashReporter;
```

When you click the "Archive" button, a thunk action creator is dispatched and an unhandled exception is thrown, to be caught and handled by the [`crashReporter`](https://github.com/patrick-fs/fs-react-redux-sentry/blob/master/src/store/crashReporter.js) middleware.

This middleware will capture any uncaught reducer errors as well as any action creator error thrown from a thunk. Unaught exceptions thrown from plain action creators will not be caught by this middleware.

## Monitor, Alert, Watch, Fix
Bug-awareness is the critical first step in maintaining quality in your applications. Sentry let's you know that your users may be feeling pain. FullStory shows you exactly _what_ they are doing in those moments before an error strikes and gives you the complete picture you need to remediate issues as fast as possible.
